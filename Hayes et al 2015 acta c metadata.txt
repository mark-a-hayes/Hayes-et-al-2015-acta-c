Metadata for Hayes et al 2015 "Not to put too fine a point on it — does increasing precision of geographic referencing improve species distribution models for a wide-ranging migratory bat?". 

Revised by Mark A. Hayes, June 23, 2017. 

The csv "Hayes et al 2015 acta c data.csv" contains the following information, which is described in the methods section:

Column A, "GENUS": The genus. All items are hoary bats, so Lasiurus.
Column B, "SPECIES": The species. All items are hoary bats, so cinerius.
Column C, "DATE": The date the occurrence was documented, in the format MM/DD/YYYY. 
Column D, "SEX": The sex of the individual. F = female, M = male, U = unknown.
Column E, "LAT_O": The original estimated latitude of the location in dedimal degree.
Column F, "LONG_O": The original estimated longitude of the location in dedimal degree.
Column G, "ERROR_O": The original estimated error in km.
Column H, "LAT_HR": The higher resolution estimated latitude of the location in dedimal degree.
Column I, "LONG_HR": The higher resolution estimated longitude of the location in dedimal degree.
Column J, "ERROR_HR": The higher resolution estimated error in km.  


This analysis should be independently reproducible following the methods section of the manuscript, and using these occurrence
locations for hoary bats. Due to its large size, the tif used the the template in this analysis has not been uploaded here. This is the North American modeling template used for the analysis. 
Characteristics of the template are described in the methods. 
See the manuscript text for full descriptions of compiliation and vetting of hoary bat data, selection of predictor variables, and 
final analysis. The full set of VisTrails-SAHM files, including the template, and associated files and data considered and used in this analysis can be obtained
